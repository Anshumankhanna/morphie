    Return an object that contains colors and layout field, both fields should be lists with 3 items at least\n
    Each item in colors list should be comprised of an object that has 'primary_color', 'secondary_color', 'accent_color' and 'background_color'\n
    background_color should be shades of black or white, consider popularly used shades for the specified website type and primary_color, secondary_color, and accent_color should be vibrant and should be of the same shade\n
    Even if layout or colors are specified, make sure no value should be left empty, the output should always have the said structure

    If the third field exists, we have an intermediate answer (just a conversation but not giving the colors and layouts),
